E-iSpec strategy:
1. To create linelist and to find the lines of Fe, C, N, O, S, and Zn (these elements are the most important in author's target sample), run the first two functions in the __main__ (keep the other functions commented):

star_spectrum, star_continuum_model, model_atmospheres, rv, rv_err = StepReduc(objName, linelist_created=0)
linemasks = StepFind(star_spectrum, star_continuum_model, model_atmospheres, rv, FeCNO=1)

2. This run will create ‘{objName}_FittedLines.pdf’ in the ‘mySample/output/{objName}/’ folder and ‘{objName}_AfterAllFilters’ in ‘mySample/output/{objName}/LineFitOutput/’. Go through the plots in the PDF file and remove poorly identified lines from the text file.
3. Once the initial filtering is done, create a text file called ‘{objName}_line_regs.txt’ in the ‘mySample/input/’ folder and fill it with the contents of the linelist you have just filtered.
4. Next, run the first and the third functions (keep the other functions commented). Depending on the linelist, this action may take up to ~1 hour):

star_spectrum, star_continuum_model, model_atmospheres, rv, rv_err = StepReduc(objName, linelist_created=1) # If the initial guess of the atmospheric parameters is good, you won’t have to create line list ever again
linemasks = StepFilter(star_spectrum, star_continuum_model, model_atmospheres, rv)

5. This run will create ‘{objName}_FittedLines_WithSynth.pdf’ in the ‘mySample/output/{objName}/’ folder. Go through the plots in this PDF file and remove blended lines from the text file.
6. Once this coarse filtering is done, run the first and the fourth functions to derive the elemental abundances (keep the other functions commented):

star_spectrum, star_continuum_model, model_atmospheres, rv, rv_err = StepReduc(objName, linelist_created=1)
linemasks, params, errors, abunds = StepStud(star_spectrum, star_continuum_model, model_atmospheres, rv)

7. Do the last fine filtering – study those lines that lead to obviously outlying abundances (as shown in the terminal output or in ‘mySample/output/{objName}/{objName}_res_abund.txt’) and try to understand whether there is any self-blending, poor normalisation, etc. You can repeat this step as many times as you need until you thoughtfully filter the outliers.
Note: The most important part of this step is to finalise the list of Fe lines, as the whole abundance analysis is very sensitive to the atmospheric parameters derived from Fe lines (Teff, logg, [Fe/H], Vmic). To aid you, there will be ‘{objName}_res_ExcitBal.pdf’ and ‘{objName}_res_SlopeEqu.pdf’ in the ‘mySample/output/{objName}/’ folder – the fitting lines in both files should be strictly horizontal (conditions of excitation and ionisation balance, respectively). After you fix the atmospheric parameters, you can fine-filter the lines of other elements.
8. Once you have set the atmospheric parameters and elemental abundances (Fe, C, N, O, S, and Zn), repeat step 1 with linelist_created=1 (since you already have a theoretical linelist) and FeCNO=0. Then repeat steps 2-7 for lines of all other elements (in step 3, just add the new lines to the existing file).

THINGS TO KEEP IN MIND: Make sure that you have multiple options for deriving stellar parameters and elemental abundances (i.e., not only with a grid). If you only have a “grid” option, then make sure you installed all required packages. Usually, the problem is caused by the Cython (C-Python) compiler. To solve this problem, type in “pip install cython” or “sudo apt install cython” commands, followed by standard re-building commands: “make clean” and “make all”). Don’t forget to perform the most quintessential action in the programmer's arsenal: kill iSpec and open it again.
If Cython still misbehaves, open 'synthesizer/synthesizer.pyx' and modify line 82 in the followinng way:

cdef void callback(double num, void *f): ---> cdef void callback(double num, void *f) noexcept:
